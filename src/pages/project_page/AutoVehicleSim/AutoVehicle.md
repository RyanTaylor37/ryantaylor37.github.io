In my Autonomous Vehicles Course at Vanderbilt, me and my team developed a project to autonomously program controls on a car in order to traverse a road in a simulated environment.

The purpose of this project was to develop an autonomous taxi service system in a
simulated environment that allows a vehicle to traverse and navigate the road in order to reach
arbitrary payload locations. The virtual environment was modeled after real-world conditions, and
we are given a digital model of Chevy SUV, along with two cameras, GPS, IMU, and LIDAR
sensors in order to interact with the world and generate the command systems needed to control
the steering and acceleration of our vehicle. In addition to the goal of transporting our vehicle to
a specified payload destination, we also had to respect various traffic laws and avoid collisions
with other vehicles.
