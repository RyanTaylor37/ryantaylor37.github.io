As a part of the Vanderbilt Robotics Team competing in the NASA Lunabotics competition, we built an autonomous robot that can navigate in a lunar environment to extract materials from the ground and then travel to a deposition site to deposit acquired material.

Designing an autonomous drive control system to optimally traverse and navigate a track while avoiding obstacles

Developed navigational algorithm by constructing local and global mapping using an Intel RealSense camera and ROS2 architecture.
