Developed a Project Portfolio Website as a way to compile and display all the projects I've worked on. 

Taught myself JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Gatsby , Firebase, and GraphQL and took courses on how to use these software tools to develop a website.

Developed a localized database to manage projects and curate templatized and nuanced deployment pages according to the specific assets of any arbitrary project.

Programmed querying algorithm to service database and retreive project assets to display on unique URl id.
