Encoded a Pololu 3Pi Robot to navigate and traverse a maze autonomously. Then calculate the optimal path and traverse the maze a second time without making any redundant traversals. 

Designed a control loop that allows the robot to follow a black line using infrared sensors and course correct itself if it veers off the path and records its position as it traverses the maze.
