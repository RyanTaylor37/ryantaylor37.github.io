Launched weather balloon to test preliminary designs and operating conditions for the PCB circuit, sensory devices, and communication systems.

Designed communications interface to connect weather balloon with ground operations and implementing relevant software on Raspberry Pi to successfully broadcast sensory data with radio frequencies to ground with APRS.

Programmed sensory devices to communicate and operate on the Raspberry Pi and provide data acquisition to test data aggregation at elevated positions. 

Designed circuitry and control logic to allow communications between weather balloon with ground operations and implementing relevant software on Raspberry Pi to successfully sample and broadcast sensory data with radio frequencies to ground.
