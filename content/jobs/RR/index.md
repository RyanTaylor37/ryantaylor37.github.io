- Perform behavorial analysis on a legacy Simulink engine model and correlate its output data to validate its fidelity with modern engine simulations used by Rolls-Royce

- Comprehensively understand the architecture of the [AE3007N engine](https://www.rolls-royce.com/products-and-services/civil-aerospace/business-aviation/ae-3007.aspx#section-technology) and how its electro-mechanical systems are emulated within the Simulink model

- Revised plotting scripts and interpolation algorithms needed to correlate engine simulation datasets and implement robust UI elements to facilitate analysis
