Hello! I'm Chandrika Deb, from Jamshedpur, also known as Pittsburgh of India.

Currently, I'm the Chapter Lead of [GirlScript Foundation](https://www.girlscript.tech/) for my city Jamshedpur and Tech Content Writer for [Open Source Code](https://opensourcecode.tech/)

Shortly after graduating from [BIT Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/), I will be joining the Revenue Management (RM) team at [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com/), Pune.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
