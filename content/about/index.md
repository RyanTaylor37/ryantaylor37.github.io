Hello! My name is Ryan Taylor and I enjoy doing engineering projects! It all started when I made simple circuit that could charge my phone with solar and mechanical energy. During my tenure at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), I developed a passion for embedded systems. I love doing projects that interface with both the hardware and sofware side of various technologies. 

In my free time, you can find me hundled somewhere reading a fantasy or sci-fi book or playing video games with my friends. I've recently gotten into hiking to and like to explore new places in nature!

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
